{"name":"Xtl-converter","tagline":"Converts from VESTA to µSTEM file format for TEM multislice simulations.","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nXTL-Converter is a simple Python script that converts a VESTA crystal file into the format used by the µSTEM multislice simulation program developed by Leslie Allen et al. at the University of Melbourne.\r\n\r\nFor more information about µSTEM, please visit: [µSTEM](http://tcmp.ph.unimelb.edu.au/mustem/muSTEM.html)\r\n\r\nTo download the VESTA crystal viewer, please visit: [VESTA](http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/)\r\n\r\n### Installation and Usage\r\n\r\nRequirements: Python Environment (2.7+) and input VESTA file\r\n\r\nInput File: The program takes an input VESTA fractional coordinates (*.xtl) file. First build your crystal in VESTA and apply any coordinate transformation needed to align the principal axes to the zone-axis of interest. Then export the fractional coordinates.\r\n\r\nNext copy the script to the folder containing your input VESTA file.\r\n\r\nTo run: Execute the command 'python xtl_converter.py input.xtl'\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\nv1.0 – 10/07/15 – Initial release.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to Nathan Lugg (University of Tokyo) for helpful discussions.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThis script was developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, managed by Battelle Inc. for the Department of Energy. The script is released under an open source license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
